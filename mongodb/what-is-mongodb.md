# Chapter 1: What is Mongodb?

Mongodb is a NoSQL database that uses collections and documents to store data, opposed to the legacy relational structure of tables of row and columns

## Lecture Notes

- Document: a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.

- Field: a unique identifier for a datapoint.

- Value: data related to a given identifier.

- Collection: an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

- Replica Set: a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate: to copy something.

- Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.

- Cluster: group of servers that store your data.
