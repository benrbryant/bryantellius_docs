# Chapter 4: Requirements Engineering

- Requirement gathering is made up of
  1. gathering requirements, **understanding the problem**
  2. representing requirements, **describing the problem**
  3. validating requirements, **agreeing upon the problem**
- Requirements can be categorized as
  - **requirement definitions** (for the system user)
  - **requirement specifications** (for the engineering team)
  - **functional requirements** (services a system provides)
  - **non-functional requirements** (operational system restraints)
- Challenges for requirements
  - **imprecision**, **agreement**, and **creep**
- Other considerations
  - **scalability**, **security**, and **Total Cost of Ownership (TOC)**
- Team techniques (involving dev team, managers, stakeholders, sponsors, users, et al)
  - **Joint Application Development (JAD)**, produces excellent requirements models, but at a cost (personnel in availability in meetings costs money)
  - **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**, produces systems at reduced cost
  - **Agile methods**, produces systems iteratively
