# Chapter 4: Requirements Engineering

- Requirement gathering is made up of
  1. gathering requirements, **understanding the problem**
  2. representing requirements, **describing the problem**
  3. validating requirements, **agreeing upon the problem**
- Requirements can be categorized as
  - **requirement definitions** (for the system user)
  - **requirement specifications** (for the engineering team)
  - **functional requirements** (services a system provides)
  - **non-functional requirements** (operational system restraints)
- Challenges for requirements
  - **imprecision**, **agreement**, and **creep**
- Other considerations
  - **scalability**, **security**, and **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
- Team techniques (involving dev team, managers, stakeholders, sponsors, users, et al)
  - **Joint Application Development (JAD)**, produces excellent requirements models, but at a cost (personnel in availability in meetings costs money)
  - **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**, produces systems at reduced cost
  - **Agile methods**, produces systems iteratively
- **Fact finding** involves collecting information for requirements
- **Interviews** are a fact finding technique for collecting information from another person through prepared questions
- **Informal structure** seek to define interpersonal relationships
- Interview steps
  - Determine the people to interview
  - Establish objectives for the interview
  - Develop interview questions
  - Prepare for the interview
  - Conduct the interview
  - Document the interview
  - Evaluate the interview
- Interviews utilize **open-ended**, **closed-ended**, and **range-of-response** questions
- Other helpful techniques
  - **document review**
  - **observation**
  - **questionnaires**
  - **brainstorming**
  - **sampling**
  - **research**
- Requirements can be represented in several ways
  - **natural language**
  - **diagrams** (e.g. **functional decomposition diagrams**, **business process diagrams**, and **data flow diagrams**)
  - **models**, created with **Universal Modeling Language (UML)** (e.g. **use case diagrams**, **sequence diagrams**)
- Validation and Verification of requirements consist of the following
  - validity, consistency, completeness, realism, verifiability, comprehensibility, traceability, and adaptability
