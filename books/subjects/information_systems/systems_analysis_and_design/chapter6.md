# Chapter 6: Object Modeling

- **Object-oriented analysis (O-O)** identifies objects
  - end product is an **object model**
- **Objects** consist of **attributes** and **methods**
  - can respond to **messages**
- OO concepts
  - **polymorphism**
  - **encapsulation**
  - **inheritance**
  - **abstraction**
  - **classes**
    - **superclasses** and **subclasses**
- **Use cases**
  - use cases are **ovals**
  - actors are **stick figures**
  - associations are **blue arrows**
  - use cases that use other use cases are **green arrows pointing _towards_ the used use case**
  - use case descriptions include
    - use case, actor, description of action, preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions
- **Use case diagrams**
  - display several actors and use cases that are related
  - use case **system boundaries** are blue shaded rectangles that contain the use cases, with actors being outside
- **Class diagrams** detail classes and relationships involved in a use case
  - includes **cardinality** notation
    - **0..\*** zero to many
    - **0..1** zero to one
    - **1** one
    - **1..\*** 1 to many
- **Sequence diagrams** are dynamic models of use cases that display classes, messages, and interactions during a time period
    - classes are green rectangles
    - lifelines are dotted lines
    - messages are red arrows
    - focuses are ovals surrounding portions of the lifeline
- **State transition diagrams** show how state changes throughout objects
    - states are rectangles
    - shaded circle on the left is the beginning state
    - open circle on the right is the finished state
    - lines connect the state transitions
- **Activity diagrams** are similar ot state transition diagrams, but shows activities taking place and their outcomes
    - resembles horizontal flowchart
    - arrows (preconditions/postconditions) flow into rectangles (activities)
