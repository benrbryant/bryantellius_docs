# Chapter 3: Managing System Projects

- Task duration is measured in how many units it takes a person to complete a task, or **person-units**, depending on the unit of measurement used (e.g. days - **person-days**, hours - **person-hours**)
- Duration can be calculated by estimating the following values and formula
  - **best case (B)**, **probable case (P)**, and **worst case (W)**
  - (B + 4P + W)/6
  - Example: best estimate - 2 days, worst estimate - 10 days, probable estimate - 4 days
  - (2 + 16 + 10)/6 = 4.66 days
- Estimation is based on **project size**, **HR resources**, **experience with similar projects**, and **project constraints**
- **Work Breakdown Structures (WBSs)** break down the work that needs to be down into tasks
  - **task name**, **duration**, and **predecessor** are minimum fields
  - follow **task patterns** that define the sequence to complete the tasks
    - patterns include **dependent tasks**, **multiple successor tasks**, and **multiple predecessor tasks**
- **Project Estimate Review Technique (PERT)**/**Critical Path Method (CPM)** represents project tasks with **task boxes**
  - task boxes contain **task name**, **task id**, **start date**, **end date**, and **task duration**
- The **critical path** is the sequence of tasks that, if delayed, will affect the completion date of the entire project
- **Slack time** is the amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the completion date of the entire project
- **Structure walkthroughs**, or reviews, happen at different phases of the SDLC and are typically down technical peers
- **Risks** are any events that could negatively impact a project
- **Risk Management** is the process of identifying, monitoring, and mitigating risks to a project
  - Develop a **risk management plan**
  - Identify risks
  - Analyze the risks
    - **Qualitative analysis** includes probability and impact ratings
    - **Quantitative analysis** includes actual impact to project scope, budge, timeline, etc
  - Create a **risk response plan**
  - Monitor risks
- **Brook's Law** states that adding staff resources to a software project late in the process actually lengthens the project timeline
