# Chapter 5: Data and Process Modelling

- **Logical models** represent _what_ a system must do
- **Physical models** represent _how_ a system will be constructed
- **Data Flow Diagrams** are visual representations of how data moves through an information system
  - **Gane and Sarson** symbols
    - **process** - rounded squares or circles
    - **data flow** - arrows
    - **data stores** - skinny, horizontal rectangles
    - **external entities** - squares with box shadow
- **All processes must have an incoming data flow and an outgoing data flow**
- **All data flows must have at least one process at either end**
- **All data stores must be connected to a process with an incoming _and_ outgoing data flow**
- Incorrect flows
  - **spontaneous generation**
  - **black holes**
  - **gray holes**
- **Context diagram** is the top-level view of the information system and shows the boundaries and scope
  - defines **process 0**
- **Diagram 0** defines the overview of the components that make up the overall system
- Diagrams are decomposed enough when the processes reach **functional primitives** that cannot be further broken down
- **Leveling and balancing** refers to drawing levels of more complex, details diagrams and keeping the input and output flows consistent
- Process numbers are represented as decimal numbers that represent their number and sub numbers (e.g. 1.2.3 means 3rd sub process of the 1st process's 2nd process)
- **Data Dictionaries** are central storehouses of information about a system
- **Data element (field)** is the smallest piece of data with meaning within a system
- **Data structures (records)** are records that are typically stored in a structured database and used within data stores and data flows
  - made up of attributes
    - **name or label**
    - **alias**
    - **type and length**
    - **default value**
    - **acceptable values**
    - **source**
    - **security**
    - **responsible users**
    - **additional comments**
- Documentation of DFDs
  - data flow
    - **name**, **description**, **alternate name**, **origin**, **destination**, **record**, and **volume and frequency**
  - data store
    - **name**, **description**, **alterate name**, **attributes**, and **volume and frequency**
  - process
    - **name**, **description**, **process number**, and **process description**
  - entities
    - **name**, **description**, **alternate name**, and **input and output data flows**
  - records
    - **name**, **description**, **alternate name**, and **attributes**
- **Process descriptions** document the details of functional primitives
- **Modular Design** consists of three logical elements
  - **sequence**
  - **selection**
  - **iteration (recursion)**
- **Decision tables** are used to convey a complex set of conditions and outcomes
- **Decision trees** are used to graphically convey decision tables
