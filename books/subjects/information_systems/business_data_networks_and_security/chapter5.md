# Chapter 5: Ethernet (802.3) Switched LANs

- **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that operates on a customer, or local, premise
- Ethernet standards are determined IEEE Standards association's 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, or 802.3 Working Group
- **Workgroup switches** connect hosts to the network
- **Core switches** connect switches
- **Access links** connect individual hosts to workgroup switches
- **Trunk links** connect switches to other switches
- **Binary signaling** is transmitted in 2 states (e.g. 0 or 1)
- **Digital signaling** is transmitted in multiples states dependent on the system (all power of two e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16)
- **Clock cycle** refers to the time in which a receiver can read a signal
- Ethernet uses two types of cabling
  - **4 Pair Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)** cabling
    - 8 copper wire twisted into 4 pairs, transmitted in each direction simultaneously, called **parallel transmission**
  - **Optical** cabling
    - sent via light or no light
    - measured in **wavelengths** (length between peaks) and **amplitude** (power, i.e. brightness)
    - three windows 850nm, 1310nm, 1550nm
    - **Multimode** vs **singlemode** refer to how many angles, or **modes**, light is able to enter a fiber optic cable
      - the smaller the cable the closer to singlemodal, although better for transmission, this is more expensive
- **Link aggregation** refers to adding physical links, trunk links, between switches to _increase the speed_
- Ethernet has many different _physical link layer_ standards, but only one major _data link layer_ standard, **802.3 MAC Layer Standard**
- **Hierarchical Topology** refers to the hierarchy, or physical organization, that switched networks are designed in to avoid loops
- **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)** is the act of networks recognizing a problem in the network (i.e. loop) and closing problematic physical ports
- **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)** are virtualized network segregations that allow clusters of servers to communicate within their own network
- **802.1X Port-Based Network Access Controll** is the standard that provides authentication before a user has access to communicate over a certain port
- **802.1AE** requires switches to authenticate themselves before communicating with other switches, and communication is encrypted
