# Chapter 5: Ethernet (802.3) Switched LANs

- **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that operates on a customer, or local, premise
- Ethernet standards are determined IEEE Standards association's 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, or 802.3 Working Group
- **Workgroup switches** connect hosts to the network
- **Core switches** connect switches
- **Access links** connect individual hosts to workgroup switches
- **Trunk links** connect switches to other switches
- **Binary signaling** is transmitted in 2 states (e.g. 0 or 1)
- **Digital signaling** is transmitted in multiples states dependent on the system (all power of two e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16)
- **Clock cycle** refers to the time in which a receiver can read a signal
- Ethernet uses two types of cabling
  - **4 Pair Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)** cabling
    - 8 copper wire twisted into 4 pairs, transmitted in each direction simultaneously, called **parallel transmission**
  - **Optical** cabling
